# papersortingmood
This is a small music app for my beloved colleagues at ESA Jakelut Oy. Papersortingmood is a collection of different genre of EDM songs that we usually listen while working.

I hate that my colleagues always have to look for a certain song on Youtube every time. I personally hate Youtube, so many ads.

That's why I create this site using SoundClound API & jQuery, with responsive framework, Bootstrap 3. Single click. Non-stop music. No ads anymore

PapersortingMood includes Progressive House, Future House, Trap, Dubstep, Tropical House, Ambient and so on. I divided those genres into 2 categories: Partymood and Chillmood.

It was designed and developed in just 2 weeks, and introduced me to the world of web app development.
